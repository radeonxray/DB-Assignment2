# Assignment 

Your task is to implement a small database application, which imports a dataset of Twitter tweets from the CSV file into database.

Your application has to be able to answer queries corresponding to the following questions:
- How many Twitter users are in the database?
- Which Twitter users link the most to other Twitter users? (Provide the top ten.)
- Who is are the most mentioned Twitter users? (Provide the top five.)
- Who are the most active Twitter users (top ten)?
- Who are the five most grumpy (most negative tweets) and the most happy (most positive tweets)? (Provide five users for each group)

Your application can be written in the language of your choice. It must have a form of UI but it is not important if it is an API, a CLI UI, a GUI, or a Web-based UI.
You present your system's answers to the questions above in a Markdown file on your Github account. That is, you hand in this assignment via Github, with one hand-in per group. Push your solution, source, code, and presentation of the results to a Github repository per group and push a link to your solution in the hand-in area.
